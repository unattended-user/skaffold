Skaffold
========

Image to help CI/CD pipelines needing [Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/). This image is built on top of 
[Docker](https://hub.docker.com/_/docker) image, and also includes
[kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/kubectl/) and [Helm](https://helm.sh/).

For ease of use when using tools manually **bash** is installed and autocomplete for all the installed tools is
 enabled.
